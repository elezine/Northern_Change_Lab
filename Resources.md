# Resources and tutorials

## All-in-one tutorials for earth data science
* Earth Lab at University of Colorado, Boulder (Earth Data Analytics Online Certificate): 
  * [Online "textbook:" Introduction to Earth Data Science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/) - zero to hero tutorial covering bash, python, git/github, and data science workflows - The best all in one tutorial on these topics I have seen!
  * [Workshop: Get Started With GIS in Open Source Python - Geopandas, Rasterio & Matplotlib](https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/gis-open-source-python/) - Covers similar material to geohackweek, but with more brevity

* [Geo-Python Course](https://geo-python.github.io/site/index.html)  (Department of Geosciences and Geography,  University of Helsinki)

* Five spatial python/QGIS [tutorials](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/index.html), recently made freely available by the author, Ujaval Gandhi. Recommended:
  * [Python Foundation for Spatial Analysis (Full Course Material)](https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/python-foundation.html): Lengthy, and more spatially-focused than CU Earth Lab course (above), but less flashy and current than geohack week.

* [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html) - "This book grew out of a course developed at Columbia University called Research Computing in Earth Science. It was written mostly by Ryan Abernathey, with significant contributions from Kerry Key and Tim Crone. By separating the book from the class, we hope to create an open-source community resource for Python education in the Earth and Environmental Sciences."

## Learning programming
1. [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](https://howtothink.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html): An online, html textbook for an introduction to programming (in Python 3). Referenced in MIT 6.00.

## Learning python
Python and its numerical array programming package, numpy, have become so ubiquitous in the sciences that they were the topic of a 2020 review [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2) in Nature!

1. A [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) provided by the developers of python- not recommended for beginners because it is quite formal and technical. Good for reference, though.

2. [An introduction to Python for scientific computing](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/python.pdf) (M. Scott Shell / UCSB) - To the point and written by a biochemical modeling professor

3. [Python Like You Mean It](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/): this looks good! Written by a former physics grad student who wished something like this had existed when they started. Described as "a free resource for learning the basics of Python & NumPy, and moreover, becoming a competent Python user," and "a lean, one-stop resource for learning the essentials of Python from scratch."

4. Basic, interactive [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) from W3Schools.com with advertisements.

5. A bare-bones, interactive, 10-minute-long [tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/) in python basics, with a more detailed version available for purchase at DataCamp.

6. MIT 6.00: [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/): How Ethan learned programming and python. Not recommended because it is quite verbose! It is also taught in python 2.xx, while python 3.xx is now current. 

7. [An Introduction to Numpy and Scipy](https://sites.engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/numpy.pdf)  (M. Scott Shell / UCSB) - A great introduction to the basic functions available in numpy. Can also be used as a reference guide.

8. Matplotlib plotting style [guide](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)

9. One-page "cheat sheets" for common python data science packages:
 * [Numpy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Numpy_Python_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
 * Many others...just google cheat sheets for numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, xarray

10. Old school? Here are some textbooks:
* [Primer on Scientific Programming with Python](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.revproxy.brown.edu/lib/brown/detail.action?docID=1030580) (Hans Petter Langtangen, Springer, 2012)
* [Python Data Science Handbook](https://www-oreilly-com.revproxy.brown.edu/library/view/python-data-science/9781491912126/?ar) (Jake VanderPlas) - more recent, includes linear regression, machine learning, and one computer vision application
* [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools,and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781838826048/) by Aurélien Géron (available online through Brown Library)

## Python for tabular data analysis: pandas package
1. A list of [tutorials](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/tutorials.html) from pydata.org.

2. Geohackweek and Intro to Earth Data Science online textbook chapters

## Shell scripting in bash
Bash is the most commonly used shell scripting language in minutes systems, and is often the default.  It is the go-to for scientific processing workflows, and can be used to run other programs: python, matlab, etc. It is delightfully old-school, yet highly powerful.

### Step one: install the windows subsystem for linux
...or Docker, Virtual Box, or git-bash. WSL is available from the microsoft [store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for free and I find it the most convenient way to run Linux on a Windows machine in a fast, low-resource way. Bonus: WSL integrates with the text editor Visual Studio Code.

1. Lynda tutorial on ["Linux: Bash Shell and Scripts"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/linux-bash-shell-and-scripts/): requires LinkedIn Learning membership, which Brown subscribes to. Information should be fairly easy to understand, but will take some time to watch the videos.

2. [The linux documentation project](http://tldp.org/guides.html): lots of useful, if dated, guides and code snippets to learn with. For a quick crash course, or info on a specific topic, try the [Bash Guide for Beginners](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html) by Machtelt Garrels and [Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) by Mendel Cooper.

## Geocomputation workflows

1. [Geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io/): An up-to-date resource for geoprocessing workflows in Python, introduced through a series of python Jupiter notebook tutorials. Thanks to The University of Washington organizers for offering these workshops and archiving the tutorials!

2. Spatial-ecology.net workshops and [tutorials](http://spatial-ecology.net/dokuwiki/doku.php): Now preserved on Youtube, this site gives introductions to a variety of geospatial processing, including command line programs like gdal, and GIS software like QGIS and GRASS. Includes some introduction to linux, bash, and python as well. Thank you to Giuseppe Amatulli at Yale for hosting this site.
